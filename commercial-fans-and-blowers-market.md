<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Fans and Blowers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans and Blowers</li><li>Axial Fans and Blowers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial fans and blowers market includes two primary types: centrifugal fans and blowers, and axial fans and blowers. Centrifugal fans utilize a rotating impeller to generate high-pressure airflow, making them suitable for applications requiring strong air movement against resistance, likeHVAC systems and industrial processes. Axial fans, on the other hand, move air along the axis of the fan, providing a more direct airflow suited for applications needing high volume at low pressure, such as cooling and ventilation systems.</p></p>
