<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overload Protection Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Overload</li><li>Magnetic Overload</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The overload protection relay market is primarily segmented into thermal and magnetic overload relays. Thermal overload relays utilize bimetallic strips that bend and break the circuit when excessive current generates heat, protecting motors from overheating. In contrast, magnetic overload relays rely on electromagnetic mechanisms, activating a trip when current exceeds a predetermined level, offering faster response times. Both types serve crucial roles in electrical systems, enhancing safety and extending equipment lifespan by preventing damage due to overload conditions.</p></p>
